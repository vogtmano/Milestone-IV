Day 50 of 100 Days Of Swift

Projects 10-12

## Challenge

Your challenge is to put two different projects into one: Iâ€™d like you to let users take photos of things that interest them, add captions to them, then show those photos in a table view. Tapping the caption should show the picture in a new view controller, like we did with project 1. So, your finished project needs to use elements from both project 1 and project 12, which should give you ample chance to practice.
